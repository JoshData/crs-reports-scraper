    <p class="SummaryHeading" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Summary</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is comprised of nine members, two ex officio members, and other members as appointed by the President representing major departments and agencies within the federal executive branch. While the group generally has operated in relative obscurity, the proposed acquisition of commercial operations at six U.S. ports by Dubai Ports World in 2006 placed the group's operations under intense scrutiny by Members of Congress and the public. Prompted by this case, some Members of the 109<sup>th</sup> and 110<sup>th</sup> Congresses questioned the ability of Congress to exercise its oversight responsibilities given the general view that CFIUS's operations lack transparency. Other Members revisited concerns about the linkage between national security and the role of foreign investment in the U.S. economy. Some Members of Congress and others argued that the nation's security and economic concerns had changed following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and that those concerns were not being reflected sufficiently in the Committee's deliberations. In addition, anecdotal evidence seemed to indicate that the CFIUS process was not market neutral. Instead, a CFIUS investigation of an investment transaction may have been perceived by some firms and by some in the financial markets as a negative factor that added to uncertainty and may have spurred firms to engage in behavior that may not have been optimal for the economy as a whole. On March 14, 2017, Senator Charles Grassley introduced <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/z?d115:S.616:"><span class="Hyperlink">S. 616</span></a> to include the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services as permanent members of the CFIUS and to include the national security impact of foreign investments in the food and agriculture systems as part of the criteria the Committee uses in deciding to recommend that the President block a foreign acquisition.</p>

On January 23, 2008, President Bush issued Executive Order 13456 implementing the law.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is an interagency committee that serves the President in overseeing the national security implications of foreign investment in the economy. Since its inception, CFIUS has operated at the nexus of shifting concepts of national security, especially relative to various notions of national economic security, and a changing global economic order marked in part by such emerging economies as China that are playing a more active role in the global economy. Some policymakers argue that foreign investment transactions, particularly by entities owned or controlled by a foreign government, compromise U.S. national economic security. In response, some policymakers argue that CFIUS reviews of foreign investment transactions should shift from a voluntary review process, with some caveats, to a mandatory approval process for all foreign investment transactions. Some policymakers also argue that the CFIUS review process should have a more robust economic component, possibly even to the extent of an industrial policy-type approach that uses the CFIUS national security review process to protect and promote certain industrial sectors in the economy.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Originally established by an Executive Order of President Ford in 1975, the committee generally has operated in relative obscurity.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn1" href="#fn1" title="Executive Order 11858 (b), May 7, 1975, 40 F.R. 20263.">1</a></sup> According to a Treasury Department memorandum, the Committee originally was established in order to placate Congress, which had grown concerned over the rapid increase in investments by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) countries in American portfolio assets (Treasury securities, corporate stocks and bonds), and to respond to concerns of some that much of the OPEC investments were being driven by political, rather than by economic, motives.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn2" href="#fn2" title="U.S. Congress.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Thirty years later, public and congressional concerns about the proposed purchase of commercial port operations of the British-owned Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O)<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn3" href="#fn3" title="Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company is a leading ports operator and transport company with operations in ports, ferries, and property development.

Some Members of Congress and the public argued that the nation's economic and national security concerns had fundamentally changed as a result of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and that these changes required a reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and in the nation's security. As a result of the attention by both the public and Congress, DP World officials announced that they would sell off the U.S. port operations to an American owner.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn5" href="#fn5" title="Weisman, Jonathan, and Bradley Graham, &quot;Dubai Firm to Sell U.S. Port Operations,&quot; The Washington Post , March 10, 2006. p. A1.">5</a></sup> On December 11, 2006, DP World officials announced that a unit of AIG Global Investment Group, a New York-based asset management company with large assets, but no experience in port operations, would acquire the U.S. port operations for an undisclosed amount.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn6" href="#fn6" title="King, Neil Jr., and Greg Hitt, Dubai Ports World Sells U.S. Assets—AIG Buys Operations that Ignited Controversy As Democrats Plan Changes.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Members of Congress introduced more than 25 bills in the second session of the 109<sup>th</sup> Congress that addressed various aspects of foreign investment since the proposed DP World transaction. In the first session of the 110<sup>th</sup> Congress, Members approved, and President Bush signed, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, designated as <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>, that alters the CFIUS process in order to provide greater oversight by Congress and increased reporting by the Committee on its decisions. In addition, <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a> broadened the definition of national security and required greater scrutiny by CFIUS of certain types of foreign direct investments. The law demonstrated the concern some Members had with the way CFIUS operated and with the lack of transparency in the CFIUS review process that some Members believed had hampered Congress's ability to exercise its oversight responsibilities. Not all Members were satisfied with the law. Some Members argued that the law remained deficient in reviewing investment by foreign governments through sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), an issue that was just beginning to attract attention when the law was adopted. In early 2011, some Members of Congress had requested that the Obama Administration support a recommendation by CFIUS that the President block a proposed acquisition of 3Leaf Systems by Huawei Technologies over national security concerns. Instead, Huawei discontinued its efforts to acquire the U.S. firm.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Information on international investment and production collected and published by the United Nations indicates that foreign direct investment peaked in 2007 prior to the global financial crisis and has not fully recovered. Similarly, from 2012 through 2014, international flows of foreign direct investment fell below the levels reached prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Cross-border merger and acquisition activity (M&amp;As) picked up in 2014, after lagging behind the pace set in 2008, although global nominal gross domestic product (GDP) generally has risen since 2009. Globally, at 79 million, employment of the foreign affiliates of international firms has surpassed the 77 million recorded in 2007. Other measures of international production, sales, assets, value-added production, and exports all indicate higher nominal values in 2015, which provides further evidence that the global economic growth is recovering, although at a slow pace.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">President Ford's 1975 Executive Order established the basic structure of CFIUS, and directed that the &quot;representative&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn7" href="#fn7" title="The term &quot;representative&quot; was dropped by Executive Order 12661, December 27, 1988, 54 FR 780.">7</a></sup> of the Secretary of the Treasury be the chairman of the Committee. The Executive Order also stipulated that the Committee would have &quot;the primary continuing responsibility within the executive branch for monitoring the impact of foreign investment in the United States, both direct and portfolio, and for coordinating the implementation of United States policy on such investment.&quot; In particular, CFIUS was directed to (1) arrange for the preparation of analyses of trends and significant developments in foreign investments in the United States; (2) provide guidance on arrangements with foreign governments for advance consultations on prospective major foreign governmental investments in the United States; (3) review investments in the United States which, in the judgment of the Committee, might have major implications for United States national interests; and (4) consider proposals for new legislation or regulations relating to foreign investment as may appear necessary.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn8" href="#fn8" title="Executive Order 11858 (b), May 7, 1975, 40 F.R. 20263.">8</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">President Ford's Executive Order also stipulated that information submitted &quot;in confidence shall not be publicly disclosed&quot; and that information submitted to CFIUS be used &quot;only for the purpose of carrying out the functions and activities&quot; of the order. In addition, the Secretary of Commerce was directed to perform a number of activities, including</p>
    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(1) obtaining, consolidating, and analyzing information on foreign investment in the United States;</p>
    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(2) improving the procedures for the collection and dissemination of information on such foreign investment;</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Executive Order, however, raised questions among various observers and government officials who doubted that federal agencies had the legal authority to collect the types of data that were required by the order. As a result, Congress and the President sought to clarify this issue, and in the following year President Ford signed the International Investment Survey Act of 1976.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn9" href="#fn9" title="P.L. 94-472 , Oct 11, 1976; 22 USC 3101.">9</a></sup> The act gave the President &quot;clear and unambiguous authority&quot; to collect information on &quot;international investment.&quot; In addition, the act authorized &quot;the collection and use of information on direct investments owned or controlled directly or indirectly by foreign governments or persons, and to provide analyses of such information to the Congress, the executive agencies, and the general public.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn10" href="#fn10" title="P.L. 94-472 , Oct ober 11, 1976; 22 USC Sec tion 3101(b).">10</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">By 1980, some Members of Congress had come to believe that CFIUS was not fulfilling its mandate. Between 1975 and 1980, for instance, the Committee had met only 10 times and seemed unable to decide whether it should respond to the political or the economic aspects of foreign direct investment in the United States.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn11" href="#fn11" title="U.S. Congress. House. Committee on Government Operations. The Adequacy of the Federal Response to Foreign Investment in the United States . Report by the Committee on Government Operations.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">From 1980 to 1987, CFIUS investigated a number of foreign investments, mostly at the request of the Department of Defense. In 1983, for instance, a Japanese firm sought to acquire a U.S. specialty steel producer. The Department of Defense subsequently classified the metals produced by the firm because they were used in the production of military aircraft, which caused the Japanese firm to withdraw its offer. Another Japanese company attempted to acquire a U.S. firm in 1985 that manufactured specialized ball bearings for the military. The acquisition was completed after the Japanese firm agreed that production would be maintained in the United States. In a similar case in 1987, the Defense Department objected to a proposed acquisition of the computer division of a U.S. multinational company by a French firm because of classified work engaged in by the computer division. The acquisition proceeded after the classified contracts were reassigned to the U.S. parent company.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn13" href="#fn13" title="U.S. Congress. House.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In 1988, amid concerns over foreign acquisition of certain types of U.S. firms, particularly by Japanese firms, Congress approved the Exon-Florio provision, which specifies the process by which foreign investments are reviewed.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn14" href="#fn14" title="P.L. 100-418 , T itle V, Section 5021, August 23, 1988; 50 USC Appendix sect. 2170.">14</a></sup> This statute grants the President the authority to block proposed or pending foreign &quot;mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers&quot; of &quot;persons engaged in interstate commerce in the United States&quot; that threaten to impair the national security. Congress directed, however, that before this authority can be invoked the President must conclude that (1) other U.S. laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect the national security; and (2) he must have &quot;credible evidence&quot; that the foreign investment will impair the national security. This same standard was maintained in <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">By the late 1980s, Congress and the public had grown increasingly concerned about the sharp increase in foreign investment in the United States and the potential impact such investment might have on the U.S. economy. In particular, the proposed sale in 1987 of Fairchild Semiconductor Co. by Schlumberger Ltd. of France to Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan touched off strong opposition in Congress and provided much of the impetus behind the passage of the Exon-Florio provision. The proposed Fairchild acquisition generated intense concern in Congress in part because of general difficulties in trade relations with Japan at that time and because some Americans felt that the United States was declining as an international economic power as well as a world power. The Defense Department opposed the acquisition because some officials believed that the deal would have given Japan control over a major supplier of computer chips for the military and would have made U.S. defense industries more dependent on foreign suppliers for sophisticated high-technology products.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn15" href="#fn15" title="Auerbach, Stuart. Cabinet to Weigh Sale of Chip Firm. The Washington Post , March 12, 1987. p. E1.">15</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Although Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger failed in their attempt to have President Reagan block the Fujitsu acquisition, Fujitsu and Schlumberger called off the proposed sale of Fairchild.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn16" href="#fn16" title="Sanger, David E. Japanese Purchase of Chip Maker Canceled After Objections in U.S. The New York Times , March 17, 1987. p. 1.">16</a></sup> While Fairchild was acquired some months later by National Semiconductor Corp. for a discount,<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn17" href="#fn17" title="Pollack, Andrew. Schlumberger Accepts Offer. The New York Times , September 1, 1987. p. D1.">17</a></sup> the Fujitsu-Fairchild incident marked an important shift in the Reagan Administration's support for unlimited foreign direct investment in U.S. businesses and boosted support within the Administration for fixed guidelines for blocking foreign takeovers of companies in national security-sensitive industries.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn18" href="#fn18" title="Kilborn, Peter T. Curb Asked On Foreign Takeovers. The New York Times , March 18, 1987. p. D1.">18</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In 1988, after three years of often contentious negotiations between Congress and the Reagan Administration, Congress passed and President Reagan signed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn19" href="#fn19" title="P.L. 100-418 .">19</a></sup> The Exon-Florio provision, which was included as Section 5021 of that act, fundamentally transformed CFIUS from an obscure committee to an important component of U.S. foreign investment policy. The provision originated in bills reported by the Commerce Committee in the Senate and the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House, but the measure was transferred to the Senate Banking Committee as a result of a dispute over jurisdictional responsibilities.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn20" href="#fn20" title="Testimony of Patrick A. Mulloy before the Committee on Banking, Housing, &amp; Urban Affairs, October 20, 2005.">20</a></sup> In 1990, President Bush, using the authority granted under the Exon-Florio provision, directed the China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) to divest its acquisition of MAMCO Manufacturing, a Seattle-based firm producing metal parts and assemblies for aircraft, because of concerns that CATIC might gain access to technology through MAMCO that it would otherwise have to obtain under an export license.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn21" href="#fn21" title="Auerbach, Stuart. &quot;President Tells China to Sell Seattle Firm.&quot; The Washington Post , February 8, 1990, p. A1; and Benham, Barbara. &quot;Blocked Takeover Fuels Foreign Policy Flap.&quot; Investor's Daily , February 8, 1990. p. 1.">21</a></sup> </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Part of Congress's motivation in adopting the Exon-Florio provision apparently arose from concerns that foreign takeovers of U.S. firms could not be stopped unless the President declared a national emergency or regulators invoked federal antitrust, environmental, or securities laws. Through the Exon-Florio provision, Congress attempted to strengthen the President's hand in conducting foreign investment policy, while limiting its own role as a means of emphasizing that, as much as possible, the commercial nature of investment transactions should be free from political considerations. Congress also attempted to balance public concerns about the economic impact of certain types of foreign investment with the nation's long-standing international commitment to maintaining an open and receptive environment for foreign investment.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Furthermore, Congress did not intend to have the Exon-Florio provision alter the generally open foreign investment climate of the country or to have it inhibit foreign direct investments in industries that could not be considered to be of national security interest. At the time, some analysts believed the provision could potentially widen the scope of industries that fell under the national security rubric. CFIUS, however, is not free to establish an independent approach to reviewing foreign investment transactions, but operates under the authority of the President and reflects his attitudes and policies. As a result, the discretion CFIUS uses to review and to investigate foreign investment cases reflects policy guidance from the President. Foreign investors also are constrained by legislation that bars foreign direct investment in such industries as maritime, aircraft, banking, resources, and power.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn22" href="#fn22" title="CRS Report RL33103, Foreign Investment in the United States: Major Federal Statutory Restrictions , by Michael TESTDATA .">22</a></sup> Generally, these sectors were closed to foreign investors prior to passage of the Exon-Florio provision in order to prevent public services and public interest activities from falling under foreign control, primarily for national defense purposes.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Through Executive Order 12661, President Reagan implemented provisions of the Omnibus Trade Act. In the Executive Order, President Reagan delegated his authority to administer the Exon-Florio provision to CFIUS,<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn23" href="#fn23" title="Executive Order 12661 of December 27, 1988, 54 F.R. 779.">23</a></sup> particularly to conduct reviews, to undertake investigations, and to make recommendations, although the statute itself does not specifically mention CFIUS. As a result of President Reagan's action, CFIUS was transformed from a purely administrative body with limited authority to review and analyze data on foreign investment to one with a broad mandate and significant authority to advise the President on foreign investment transactions and to recommend that some transactions be blocked.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">After extensive public comment, the Treasury Department issued its final regulations in November 1991 implementing the Exon-Florio provision.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn24" href="#fn24" title="Regulations Pertaining to Mergers, Acquisitions, and Takeovers by Foreign Persons. 31 C.F.R.

Despite the voluntary nature of the notification, firms largely comply with the provision, because the regulations stipulate that foreign acquisitions that are governed by the Exon-Florio review process that do not notify the Committee remain subject indefinitely to divestment or other appropriate actions by the President. Under most circumstances, notice of a proposed acquisition that is given to the Committee by a third party, including shareholders, is not considered by the Committee to constitute an official notification. The regulations also indicated that notifications provided to the Committee would be considered confidential and the information would not be released by the Committee to the press or commented on publicly. </p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In 1992, Congress amended the Exon-Florio statute through Section 837(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (<a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d102:FLD002:@1(102+484)">P.L. 102-484</a>). Known as the &quot;Byrd&quot; amendment after the amendment's sponsor, the provision requires CFIUS to investigate proposed mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers in cases where two criteria are met:</p>
    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(1) the acquirer is controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government; and</p>
    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(2) the acquisition results in control of a person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States that could affect the national security of the United States.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn26" href="#fn26" title="P.L. 102-484 , October 23, 1992.">26</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">This amendment came under intense scrutiny by the 109<sup>th</sup> Congress as a result of the DP World transaction. Many Members of Congress and others believed that this amendment required CFIUS to undertake a full 45-day investigation of the transaction because DP World was &quot;controlled by or acting on behalf of a foreign government.&quot; The DP World acquisition, however, exposed a sharp rift between what some Members apparently believed the amendment directed CFIUS to do and how the members of CFIUS were interpreting the amendment. In particular, some Members of Congress apparently interpreted the amendment to direct CFIUS to conduct a mandatory 45-day investigation if the foreign firm involved in a transaction is owned or controlled by a foreign government. Representatives of CFIUS argued that they interpreted the amendment to mean that a 45-day investigation was discretionary and not mandatory. In the case of the DP World acquisition, CFIUS representatives argued that they had concluded as a result of an extensive review of the proposed acquisition prior to the case being formally filed with CFIUS and during the 30-day review that the DP World case did not warrant a full 45-day investigation. They conceded that the case met the first criterion under the Byrd amendment, because DP World was controlled by a foreign government, but that it did not meet the second part of the requirement, because CFIUS had concluded during the 30-day review that the transaction &quot;could not affect the national security.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn27" href="#fn27" title="Briefing on the Dubai Ports World Deal before the Senate Armed Services Committee, February 23, 2006.">27</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The intense public and congressional reaction that arose from the proposed Dubai Ports World acquisition spurred the Bush Administration in late 2006 to make an important administrative change in the way CFIUS reviewed foreign investment transactions. CFIUS and President Bush approved the acquisition of Lucent Technologies, Inc. by the French-based Alcatel SA, which was completed on December 1, 2006. Before the transaction was approved by CFIUS, however, Alcatel-Lucent was required to agree to a national security arrangement, known as a Special Security Arrangement, or SSA, that restricts Alcatel's access to sensitive work done by Lucent's research arm, Bell Labs, and the communications infrastructure in the United States.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The most controversial feature of this arrangement is that it allows CFIUS to reopen a review of the deal and to overturn its approval at any time if CFIUS believed the companies &quot;materially fail to comply&quot; with the terms of the arrangement. This marked a significant change in the CFIUS process. Prior to this transaction, CFIUS reviews and investigations had been portrayed, and had been considered, to be final. As a result, firms were willing to subject themselves voluntarily to a CFIUS review, because they believed that once an investment transaction was scrutinized and approved by the members of CFIUS the firms could be assured that the investment transaction would be exempt from any future reviews or actions. This administrative change, however, meant that a CFIUS determination may no longer be a final decision and it added a new level of uncertainty to foreign investors seeking to acquire U.S. firms. A broad range of U.S. and international business groups objected to this change in the Bush Administration's policy.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn28" href="#fn28" title="Kirchgaessner, Stephanie, US Threat to Reopen Terms of Lucent and Alcatel Deal Mergers, Financial Times , December 1, 2006.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Over time, the three step Exon-Florio process has evolved to include an informal stage of unspecified length of time that consists of an unofficial CFIUS determination prior to the formal filing with CFIUS. This type of informal review likely developed because it serves the interests of both CFIUS and the firms that are involved in an investment transaction. According to Treasury Department officials, this informal contact enabled &quot;CFIUS staff to identify potential issues before the review process formally begins.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn29" href="#fn29" title="Testimony of Robert Kimmett, Briefing on the Dubai Ports World Deal Before the Senate Armed Services Committee, February 23, 2006.">29</a></sup> This informal process continued under the provisions of <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Firms that are party to an investment transaction apparently benefit from this informal review in a number of ways. For one, it allows firms additional time to work out any national security concerns privately with individual CFIUS members. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it provides a process for firms to avoid risking potential negative publicity that could arise if a transaction were blocked or otherwise labeled as impairing U.S. national security interests. For some firms, public knowledge of a CFIUS investigation has had a negative effect on the value of the firm's stock price.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">For CFIUS members, the informal process has been beneficial because it gives them as much time as they consider necessary to review a transaction without facing the time constraints that arise under the formal CFIUS review process. This informal review likely also has given the CFIUS members added time to negotiate with firms involved in a transaction to restructure the transaction in ways that can addressed any potential security concerns or to develop other types of conditions that members feel are appropriate in order to remove security concerns.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Treasury Department's regulations also provide some guidance to firms that are deciding whether they should notify CFIUS of a proposed or pending merger, acquisition, or takeover. The guidance states that proposed acquisitions that need to notify CFIUS are those that involve &quot;products or key technologies essential to the U.S. defense industrial base.&quot; This notice is not intended for firms that produce goods or services with no special relation to national security, especially toys and games, food products, hotels and restaurants, or legal services. CFIUS has indicated that in order to assure an unimpeded inflow of foreign investment it would implement the statute &quot;only insofar as necessary to protect the national security,&quot; and &quot;in a manner fully consistent with the international obligations of the United States.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn44" href="#fn44" title="Ibid.">44</a></sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Neither Congress nor the Administration has attempted to define the term national security.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">According to the amended Exon-Florio provision, the President or any member of CFIUS can initiate a review of an investment transaction in addition to a review that is initiated by the parties to a transaction providing a formal notification. As amended, CFIUS has 30 days to review a transaction to decide after it receives the initial formal notification by the parties to a merger, acquisition, or a takeover, whether to investigate a case as a result of its determination that the investment &quot;threatens to impair the national security of the United States.&quot; National security also includes &quot;those issues relating to 'homeland security,' including its application to critical infrastructure,&quot; and &quot;critical technologies.&quot; In addition, CFIUS is required to conduct an investigation of a transaction if the Committee determines that the transaction would result in foreign control of any person engaged in interstate commerce in the United States. During such a review, the members of CFIUS are also required to consider the 12 factors that Congress has authored as a basis for assessing the impact of the investment. If during this 30-day period all of the members of CFIUS conclude that the investment does not threaten to impair the national security, the review is terminated. If, however, at least one member of the Committee determines that the investment does threaten to impair the national security CFIUS can proceed to a 45-day investigation.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">During the 30-day review stage, the Director of National Intelligence, although not a member of CFIUS, is required to carry out a thorough analysis of &quot;any threat to the national security of the United States&quot; of any merger, acquisition, or takeover. This analysis is required to be completed &quot;within 20 days&quot; of the receipt of a notification by CFIUS, but the statute directs that the DNI must be given &quot;adequate time,&quot; presumably if this national security review cannot be completed within the 20-day requirement This analysis would include a request for information from the Department of the Treasury's Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. In addition, the Director of National Intelligence is required to seek and to incorporate the views of &quot;all affected or appropriate&quot; intelligence agencies.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">CFIUS is also required to review &quot;covered&quot; investment transactions in which the foreign entity is owned or controlled by a foreign government, but the law provides an exception to this requirement. A review is exempted if the Secretary of the Treasury and certain other specified officials determine that the transaction in question will not impair the national security. It is somewhat unclear, however, how this requirement will mesh with the established process. The measure does not amend or alter the current statute in the area that has been the source of differences between CFIUS and Congress. </p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In addition, the President, acting through CFIUS, is required to conduct a National Security investigation and to take any &quot;necessary&quot; actions as part of the 45-day investigation if the review indicates that at least one of three conditions exists. These three conditions are (1) as a result of a review of the transaction, CFIUS determines that the transactions threaten to impair the national security of the United States and that the threat had not been mitigated during or prior to a review of the transaction; (2) the foreign person is controlled by a foreign government; or (3) the transactions would result in the control of any critical infrastructure by a foreign person, the transactions could impair the national security, and that such impairment had not been mitigated. At the conclusion of the investigation or the 45-day review period, whichever comes first, the Committee can decide to offer no recommendation or it can recommend that the President suspend or prohibit the investment. The President is under no obligation to follow the recommendation of the Committee to suspend or prohibit an investment.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">During a review or an investigation, CFIUS and a designated lead agency have the authority to negotiate, impose, or enforce any agreement or condition with the parties to a transaction in order to mitigate any threat to the national security of the United States. Such agreements are to be based on a &quot;risk-based analysis&quot; of the threat posed by the transaction. Also, if a notification of a transaction is withdrawn before any review or investigation by CFIUS can be completed, the amended law grants the Committee the authority to take a number of actions. In particular, the Committee could develop (1) interim protections to address specific concerns about the transaction pending a resubmission of a notice by the parties; (2) specific time frames for resubmitting the notice; and (3) a process for tracking any actions taken by any parties to the transaction.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">As previously indicated, <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a> grants the President the authority to block proposed or pending foreign &quot;mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers&quot; of &quot;persons engaged in interstate commerce in the United States&quot; that threaten to impair the national security. Congress directed that before this authority can be invoked the President must conclude that (1) other U.S. laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect the national security; and (2) that he must have &quot;credible evidence&quot; that the foreign investment will impair the national security. As a result, if CFIUS determines, as was the case in the Dubai Ports transaction, that it does not have credible evidence that an investment will impair the national security, then it argues that it is not required to undertake a full 45-day investigation, even if the foreign entity is owned or controlled by a foreign government. After considering the two conditions listed above (other laws are inadequate or inappropriate, and he has credible evidence that a foreign transaction will impair national security), the President is granted almost unlimited authority to take &quot;<em>such action for such time as the President considers appropriate to suspend or prohibit any covered transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States</em>.&quot; In addition, such determinations by the President are not subject to judicial review, although the process by which the disposition of a transaction is determined may be subject to judicial review, as was emphasized in the ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the case of Ralls vs. the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. </p>

    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(1) domestic production needed for projected national defense requirements;</p>

    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(4) potential effects of the transactions on the sales of military goods, equipment, or technology to a country that supports terrorism or proliferates missile technology or chemical and biological weapons; and transactions identified by the Secretary of Defense as &quot;posing a regional military threat&quot; to the interests of the United States;</p>
    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(5) potential effects of the transaction on U.S. technological leadership in areas affecting U.S. national security;</p>

    <p class="BlockText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">(11) long-term projection of the United States requirements for sources of energy and other critical resources and materials; and</p>

Previously, CFIUS had been directed by Treasury Department regulations to focus its activities primarily on investments that had an impact on U.S. national defense security. The additional factors, however, incorporate economic considerations into the Exon-Florio process in a way that was specifically rejected when the measure initially was adopted and refocuses CFIUS's reviews and investigations on considering the broader rubric of economic security. In particular, CFIUS is now required to consider the impact of an investment on critical infrastructure as a factor for considering recommending that the President block or postpone a transaction. Critical infrastructure is defined in broad terms within the measure as &quot;any systems and assets, whether physical or cyber-based, so vital to the United States that the degradation or destruction of such systems or assets would have a debilitating impact on national security, including national economic security and national public health or safety.&quot;</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">As originally drafted, the Exon-Florio provision also would have applied to joint ventures and licensing agreements in addition to mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers. Joint ventures and licensing agreements subsequently were dropped from the proposal because the Reagan Administration and various industry groups argued at the time that such business practices were deemed to be beneficial arrangements for U.S. companies. In addition, they argued that any potential threat to national security could be addressed by the Export Administration Act<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn47" href="#fn47" title="50 U.S.C. App. Section 2401, as amended.">47</a></sup> and the Arms Control Export Act.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn48" href="#fn48" title="22 U.S.C. App. 2778 et seq.">48</a></sup></p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Exon-Florio provision also codified confidentiality requirements that are similar to those that appeared in Executive Order 11858 by stating that any information or documentary material filed under the provision may not be made public &quot;except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial action or proceeding.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn49" href="#fn49" title="50 U.S.C.

Members of Congress and their staff members will be accountable under current provisions of law governing the release of certain types of information.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Since the implementation of the Exon-Florio provision in the 1980s, CFIUS had developed several informal practices that likely were not envisioned when the statute was drafted. In particular, members of CFIUS on occasion had negotiated conditions with firms to mitigate or to remove business arrangement that raised national security concerns among the members of CFIUS. Such agreements often were informal arrangements that had an uncertain basis in statute and had not been tested in court. These arrangements often were negotiated during the formal 30-day review period, or even during an informal process prior to the formal filing of a notice of an investment transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">According to <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>, CFIUS must designate a lead agency to negotiate, modify, monitor, and enforce agreements in order to mitigate any threat to national security. Such agreements are required to be based on a &quot;risk-based analysis&quot; of the threat posed by the transaction. CFIUS is also required to develop a method for evaluating the compliance of firms that have entered into a mitigation agreement or condition that was imposed as a requirement for approval of the investment transaction. Such measures, however, are required to be developed in such a way that they allow CFIUS to determine that compliance is taking place without also (1) &quot;unnecessarily diverting&quot; CFIUS resources from assessing any new covered transaction for which a written notice had been filed; and (2) placing &quot;unnecessary&quot; burdens on a party to an investment transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">On February 20, 2008, Bain Capital and Huawei Technologies withdrew their offer to acquire the network and software firm 3Com for $2.2 billion, due to an inability to successfully negotiate a mitigation agreement with members of CFIUS. Bain Capital is a privately held asset management and investment firm, and Huawei Technologies is the largest networking and telecommunications equipment supplier in China. 3Com was a publicly held company that specialized in networking equipment and in the Tipping Point network intrusion prevention software. Such software is used by various U.S. defense firms to prevent outside groups from accessing their confidential databases. Bain Capital and Huawei reportedly withdrew their proposal after they failed to agree to terms with CFIUS over a mitigation agreement and stated that they would restructure the deal and resubmit it at a later date in 2008.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn51" href="#fn51" title="US Insiders Point to Bain Errors Over 3Com, The Financial Times Limited , M arch 3, 2008.">51</a></sup> Eventually, 3Com was acquired by Hewlett-Packard.</p>

Also, any federal entity or entities that are involved in any mitigation agreement are to report to CFIUS if there is any modification that is made to any agreement or condition that had been imposed and to ensure that &quot;any significant&quot; modification is reported to the Director of National Intelligence and to any other federal department or agency that &quot;may have a material interest in such modification.&quot; Such reports are required to be filed with the Attorney General.</p>

In particular, CFIUS is required to brief certain congressional leaders if they request such a briefing and to report annually to Congress on any reviews or investigations that it had conducted during the prior year. CFIUS provides a classified report to Congress each year and a less extensive report for public release. Each report is required to include a list of all reviews and investigations that had been conducted, information on the nature of the business activities of the parties involved in an investment transaction, information about the status of the review or investigation, and information on any withdrawal from the process, any roll call votes by the Committee, any extension of time for any investigation, and any presidential decision or action taken under the Exon-Florio provision. In addition, CFIUS is required to report on trend information on the number of filings, investigations, withdrawals, and presidential decisions or actions that were taken.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Information on international investment and production collected and published by the United Nations indicates that foreign direct investment peaked in 2007 prior to the global financial crisis and has not fully recovered Similarly, since 2011, international flows of foreign direct investment have fallen, with such flows in 2014 outpacing only such flows in 2009 at the depth of the financial crisis. Cross-border merger and acquisition activity (M&amp;As) continues at a pace that is less than half the amount of activity recorded in 2007, although global nominal gross domestic product (GDP) has risen steadily since 2009. Globally, at 75 million, employment of the foreign affiliates of international firms has nearly reached the 77 million recorded in 2007. Other measures of international production, sales, assets, value-added production, and exports all indicate higher nominal values in 2014, which provides further that the global economic growth has not stalled, but is growing at a slow pace.</p>

During the six-year period 2008-2013, foreign investors sent 635 notices to CFIUS of plans to acquire, takeover, or merge with a U.S. firm. Of the investment transactions that were notified, about 6% were withdrawn during the initial 30-day review; about 31% of the total transactions that were notified were determined to require a 45-day investigation. Also, of the transactions that were investigated, about 7% were withdrawn before a final determination could be reached. As a result, of the 782 proposed investment transactions that were notified to CFIUS, 700 transactions, or 90% of the transactions were completed. The CFIUS report also indicates that a presidential decision was made in one of the transactions, the Ralls Corp acquisition of wind farm assets from Terna Energy SA, as discussed in a previous section of this report.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">A number of foreign investment transactions have attracted public and congressional attention to CFIUS's review process. After a lengthy review by CFIUS in 2000, Verio, Inc., a U.S. firm that operates websites for businesses and provides internet services, was acquired by NTT Communications of Japan. Verio's stock price reportedly fell during the CFIUS investigation as a result of uncertainty in the market about prospects for the transaction. The CFIUS review was instigated by the FBI, which had expressed concerns during the initial review stage that the majority interest of the Japanese government in NTT could give it access to information regarding wiretaps that were being conducted on email and other web-based traffic crossing Verio's computer system. After completing its investigation, however, CFIUS did not recommend that President Clinton block the transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The potentially negative publicity that can be associated with a CFIUS investigation of a transaction apparently has had a major impact on the transactions CFIUS has investigated. Since 1990, nearly half of the transactions CFIUS investigated were terminated by the firms involved, because the firms decided to withdraw from the transactions rather than face a negative determination by CFIUS. In 2006, for instance, the prospect of a CFIUS investigation apparently was the major reason the Israeli firm Check Point Software Technologies decided to call off its proposed $225 million acquisition of Sourcefire, a U.S. firm specializing in security appliances for protecting a corporation's internal computer networks. In addition, the decision by the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) to drop its proposed $18 billion acquisition of Unocal oil company in 2005 was partly due to concerns by CNOOC about an impending CFIUS investigation of the transaction. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In 2009, Brazilian food producer JBS agreed to pay $800 million to acquire a majority stake in Texas chicken company Pilgrim's Pride Corp., which was undergoing a bankruptcy reorganization plan. The Brazilian firm is among the world's largest meat producers; it is a major beef producer and distributor with dairy and leather industries. In a separate case, CFIUS reportedly agreed in 2013 to the pending acquisition of Sprint Nextel for $21.6 billion by the Japanese firm SoftBank. One complication with the transaction was that Sprint had agreed to acquire Clearwire for $2.2 billion. Clearwire, however, relied on the Chinese firm Huawei for equipment and for cell tower base stations. SoftBank agreed to remove Huawei as a supplier when the acquisition of Sprint was finalized. In 2014, Sprint attempted to merge with T-Mobile (owned by Deutsche Telekom of Germany), but abandoned the transaction due to regulatory concerns.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Between December 2009 and July 2010, two Chinese firms withdrew their proposed acquisitions of U.S. firms due to opposition from at least one CFIUS agency. In December 2009, the Chinese firm Northwest Nonferrous International Investment Corp., a subsidiary of China's largest aluminum producer, attempted to acquire U.S.-based Firstgold. The transactions was withdrawn by the Chinese firm due to objections by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that Firstgold had properties near sensitive military bases. In June 2010, China's Tangshan Caofedian Investment Corporation withdrew its proposed acquisition of Emcore, which makes components for fiber optics and solar panels, due to &quot;regulatory concerns.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn57" href="#fn57" title="Kirchgaessner, Stephanie , US Blocks China Fibre Optics Deal Over Security, Financial Times , June 30, 2010.">57</a></sup> In September 2012, the Chinese firm Dalian Wanda Group acquired AMC Entertainment for $2.6 billion. AMC is the owner and operator of over 338 movie theaters in the United States. With the purchase, the Chinese firm became the largest theater owner in the world.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In 2012, two investments by Chinese firms attracted public and congressional attention: an investment by the American firm Ralls Corp., owned by Chinese nationals who also owned Sany Electric Company, a Chinese electric company, in a wind farm project in Oregon, known as the Butter Creek Projects; and Wanxiang's acquisition of battery-maker A123 Systems Inc. The Ralls transaction, and the associated legal case, likely will affect CFIUS's procedures. </p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The DP World case exposed a number of important aspects of CFIUS's operations that apparently had not been well known or understood by the public in general. Many of these concerns were addressed in <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>. As already indicated, the Exon-Florio provision stipulated a three-step process: the formal notification to CFIUS and a 30-day review; a 45-day investigation for those transactions that raised national security concerns during the 30-day review and for those in which the concerns were not resolved during the review period; and a 15-day presidential determination stage for those transactions that were determined after the 45-day review to pose an impairment to national security. Over time, however, this process apparently evolved to include an informal fourth stage of unspecified length of time that consists of an unofficial CFIUS determination prior to the formal filing with CFIUS. This type of informal review developed because it likely served the interests of both CFIUS and the firms involved in an investment transaction. According to Treasury Department officials, this informal contact enables &quot;CFIUS staff to identify potential issues before the review process formally begins.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn58" href="#fn58" title="Testimony of Robert Kimmett, Briefing on the Dubai Ports World Deal before the Senate Armed Services Committee, February 23, 2006.">58</a></sup> This informal process is likely to continue under the provisions of <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>. An important difference, however, is that CFIUS gained legislative authority under <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a> to negotiate and enforce agreements with foreign investors to mitigate the effects of an investment transaction on national security.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The DP World acquisition demonstrated how this informal CFIUS process operates in reviewing a proposed foreign investment transaction. According to officials involved in the review, DP World officials contacted the Treasury Department in early October 2005 to informally discuss their proposed transaction. Treasury officials directed DP World to consult with the Department of Homeland Security and in November the Treasury officials requested an intelligence assessment from the Director of National Intelligence. Staff representatives from all of the CFIUS members met on December 6, 2005, to discuss the transaction, apparently to determine if there were any security concerns that had not been addressed and resolved during the two-month-long informal review of the proposed transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Ten days after that meeting, DP World filed its official notification with CFIUS, which distributed the notification to all of the CFIUS members and to the Departments of Energy and Transportation. During this process, the Department of Homeland Security apparently negotiated a letter of assurances with DP World that addressed some outstanding concerns about port security. On the basis of this letter and the lack of any remaining concerns expressed by any member of CFIUS or other agencies that were consulted, CFIUS completed its review of the transaction on January 17, 2006, and concluded that the transaction did not threaten to impair the national security and therefore that it did not warrant a 45-day investigation.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn59" href="#fn59" title="Ibid .">59</a></sup></p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In March 2012, Ralls acquired wind farm assets from Terna Energy SA, an Athens, Greece-based company, without reporting the transaction to CFIUS. In June, 2012, CFIUS contacted Ralls and requested that the firm file a voluntary notification to have its investment retroactively reviewed. During its initial review, CFIUS determined that Ralls's acquisition of the wind farm companies posed a national security threat as a result of objections by the U.S. Navy over the placement of wind turbines by Ralls near or within restricted Naval Weapons Systems Training Facility airspace where drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) are tested. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">On July 25, 2013, CFIUS issued an Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures to mitigate the threat posed by the acquisition and required Ralls to (1) cease all construction and operations at the Butter Creek project sites; (2) remove all stockpiled or stored items from the sites and not deposit, stockpile, or store any new items at the sites; and (3) cease all access to the sites. On July 30, 2012, CFIUS began its national security investigation of the transaction and on August 2, 2012, it issued an Amended Order Establishing Interim Mitigation Measures. In addition to the July Order restrictions, the second CFIUS Order (1) prohibited Ralls from completing any sale of the acquired wind farm sites or their assets without first removing all items (including concrete foundations) from the Butter Creek project sites; (2) required Ralls to notify CFIUS of any sale; and (3) and required Ralls to give CFIUS ten business days to object to any sale. Neither of these orders disclosed the nature of the national security threat the transaction posed nor the evidence on which CFIUS relied in issuing the orders.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Upon the recommendation of CFIUS, President Obama issued an executive order<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn60" href="#fn60" title="Order Signed by the President Regarding the Acquisition of Four U.S. Wind Farm Project Companies by Ralls Corporation, The White House, September 28, 2012. Available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/28/order-signed-president-regarding-acquisition-four-us-wind-farm-project-c .">60</a></sup> on September 28, 2012, that argued that there was credible evidence that the Ralls acquisition threatened to impair U.S. national security and ordered Ralls to divest itself of the Oregon wind farm project. In response, the Ralls Corporation filed a suit on October 1, 2012, with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the Obama Administration's authority to block the investment. The Ralls complaint included five counts: Counts I and II challenged the CFIUS Order under the Administrative Procedures Act; Count III attacked CFIUS as having exceeded its authority; and Counts IV and V challenged the constitutionality of both orders, under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause (Count IV) and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (Count V).</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">On February 22, 2013, the District Court dismissed all but the fourth complaint about Due Process in the Ralls suit, which the court indicated that Ralls could pursue through the Appeals Court. The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction in the other complaints, since the CFIUS statute states that the President's decisions are not subject to judicial review, known as a finality provision.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn61" href="#fn61" title="Ralls Corporation vs. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, et al., Civil Action Number 12-1513; available at https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012cv1513-46 .">61</a></sup> Ralls argued that the President was authorized only to &quot;suspend or prohibit&quot; a transaction, not to order a removal of equipment or a divesture. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The District Court ruled, however, that the CFIUS statute grants the President broad authority by authorizing him to take &quot;such action for such time&quot; as he considers appropriate. The suit also argued that Ralls was treated unfairly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction on this motion as well by the CFIUS statute. Nevertheless, the court indicated that its ruling would not prohibit Ralls' due process claim to proceed to the Appellate court. The Ralls' due process claim apparently focused on whether the President and/or CFIUS should be required to provide companies that proceed through the CFIUS review and investigation process with an opportunity to review, respond to, and rebut any unclassified evidence used to make a Presidential Determination. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Ralls appealed the decision<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn62" href="#fn62" title="Ralls Corporation v. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, et al.">62</a></sup> and the case was argued before the Appeals Court for the District of Columbia on May 5, 2014 and decided on July 15, 2014. In its written decision, the Appeals Court concluded that the statutory provision establishing CFIUS that bars a judicial review of a CFIUS determination did not meet the legal test of providing &quot;clear and convincing&quot; evidence that Congress intended to preclude a judicial review of due process challenges to a Presidential Order. The court concluded that the provision bars a judicial review of the final determination of the President to suspend or prohibit a transaction that threatens to impair the national security of the United States, but it also found that it does not prohibit a judicial review of a constitutional claim challenging the process that precedes a presidential action. The court determined that the Ralls complaint did not challenge the President's determination that the acquisition threatened the national security or the President's determination to prohibit the transaction in order to mitigate the national security threat. Instead, the court found that the Due Process Clause entitled Ralls to have notice of, and access to, the unclassified evidence on which the President relied and an opportunity to rebut the evidence before the President reached his determination. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Appeals Court also concluded that the Presidential Order requiring Ralls to divest itself of the wind farm sites deprived Ralls of its constitutionally protected property interests without due process of law, because Ralls never had the &quot;opportunity to tailor its submission to the Appellees' concerns or rebut the factual premises underlying the President's action.&quot; The Court found that this lack of process constituted a &quot;clear constitutional violation,&quot; notwithstanding the &quot;Appellees' substantial interest in national security and despite the court's uncertainty that more process would have led to a different presidential decision.&quot; The Court also concluded that although it had determined that the procedure followed in issuing the Presidential Order violated due process, it did not mean that the President would be required, in the future, to disclose his thinking on sensitive questions related to national security in reviewing an investment transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Following the Ralls case, the House Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct an investigation of foreign investments in mines, energy projects, or other business transactions in close proximity to Department of Defense (DOD) testing and training ranges and facilities.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn63" href="#fn63" title="Defense Infrastructure: Risk Assessment Needed to Identify if Foreign Encroachment Threatens Test and Training Ranges , GAO-15-149, United States Government Accountability Office, December 2014.">63</a></sup> The GAO investigation reported that DOD had</p><ul><li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">533 test and training ranges throughout the United States and overseas;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn64" href="#fn64" title="Ibid., p. 4.">64</a></sup> </li>

GAO also concluded that DOD interacted with a number of different agencies that are involved in identifying and approving potential business activities near to DOD facilities.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The proposed 2013 acquisition of Smithfield Foods Inc., for $4.7 billion by China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., the largest acquisition of a U.S. firm by a Chinese company up to that time, sparked intense congressional and public interest about the issue of food security as a component of the critical infrastructure/key resources rubric. Smithfield Foods was the world's leading vertically integrated pork processor and pork producer. It was the leading U.S. pork packer and producer, capturing about 26% share of the domestic U.S. hog market, and produced around 20 million-22 million hogs per year, compared with the Chinese market that slaughtered nearly 694 million hogs in 2012. The Smithfield operation spanned facilities including hog farms, pork processing and packing, and pork distribution facilities in more than a dozen states, including North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, South Dakota, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Opposition to the proposed acquisition was expressed by the National Farmers Union and the Center for Rural Affairs due to concerns over the impact on market concentration. In addition, the proposed acquisition of Smithfield Foods potentially challenged state laws that barred foreign ownership of farmland in Iowa, Missouri, and other Midwest states, given Smithfield's wide-spread operations. Some observers called for CFIIUS to appoint the Secretary of Agriculture as a temporary member of CFIUS to review the proposed transaction. Another issue was Smithfield's development and use of advanced genetic research to produce especially lean pigs that may have been desired by Shuanghui and potentially raised questions about the protection of Smithfield's intellectual property and future competition. Smithfield Foods announced on September 6, 2012, that CFIUS had decided not to oppose the proposed acquisition by Shaunghui International. Smithfield's shareholders voted overwhelmingly on September 25, 2013, to approve the transaction.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Smithfield-Shuanghui acquisition raised questions about the implications for U.S. critical infrastructure/key resources associated with this particular investment transaction, but also about U.S. food security over the long term and whether such concerns are being addressed sufficiently during a CFIUIS review or investigation. According to this argument, because Smithfield Foods was a vertically integrated company, its acquisition potentially affected a number of different markets and different parts of the food production infrastructure. In addition, the acquisition potentially provided a future competitor with the necessary resources to mount a competitive challenge to other U.S. food producers. The National Strategy for Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, adopted in the wake of the 2001 terrorist attacks, identified the critical infrastructure nature of the food and agriculture sector as, &quot;the fundamental need for food, as well as great public sensitivity to food safety makes assuring the security of food production and processing a high priority.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn66" href="#fn66" title="The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets , February 2003, p. 36.">66</a></sup> The strategy defined the food and agriculture sector as (1) the supply chains for feed, animals, and animal products; (2) crop production and the supply chains of seed, fertilizer, and other necessary related materials; and (3) the post-harvesting components of the food supply chain, from processing, production, and packaging through storage and distribution to retail sales, institutional food services, and restaurant or home consumption.</p>

According to press reports, Citgo's parent company, the Venezuela state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.

At the time, the lien was disputed by ConocoPhillips and the Canadian mining company, Crystallex, that are seeking payment for assets that were expropriated when the Venezuelan government seized international oil and mining operations based in the country during President Hugo Chavez's reign. ConocoPhillips and Crystallex argued in a federal suit against PDVSA that it was attempting to shift assets to Rosneft to avoid making payments to ConocoPhillips.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn70" href="#fn70" title="Kates, Graham, How Russian Oil Giant Rosneft Could Claim U.S. Oil, CBS News , March 9, 2017.">70</a></sup> These concerns may be moot, however, at least for the near term, because Venezuela experienced an unexpected increase in its foreign exchange reserves in March 2017 that allowed it to make its debt payment, thereby avoiding a default.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn71" href="#fn71" title="Rapoza, Kenneth, Looks Like Venezuela's PDVSA Won't Default, But Country Still a Disaster, Forbes, March 28, 2017.">71</a></sup> In addition, Rosneft and its chief operating officer, Igor Sechin, were placed under sanctions in 2014 by the United States and other countries for Russia's intervention in Ukraine.</p>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">According to the United Nations, over the past decade national security-related concerns have become more prominent in the investment policies of numerous countries. As a result, countries have adopted new measures to restrict foreign investment or have amended existing laws concerning investment-related national security reviews.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn72" href="#fn72" title="World Investment Report 2016 , United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2016, p. 95.">72</a></sup> International organizations have long recognized the legitimate concerns of nations in restricting foreign investment in certain sectors of their economies, but the recent increase in such restrictions has raised a number of policy issues. Countries have different approaches for reviewing and restricting foreign investment on national security-related grounds. These range from formal investment restrictions to complex review mechanisms with broad definitions and broad scope of application to provide host country authorities with wide discretion in the review process. As a result of these differences, foreign investors can face different entry conditions in different countries in similar economic activities.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn73" href="#fn73" title="Ibid . , p. 94.">73</a></sup> </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The U.N. analysis also concluded that national security provisions differ by the following:</p><ul><li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The concepts of &quot;national security&quot;: domestic policy approaches range from relatively narrow definitions of national security and security-related industries to broader interpretations that extend investment review procedures to critical infrastructure and strategic industries. </li>

Policy approaches include outright or partial investment prohibitions and investment approvals under certain conditions.</li></ul><p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">No country surveyed by the U.N. had a precise definition of &quot;national security&quot; relative to foreign investment. Most countries identify a number of sectors or industries, which, by their nature, may pose national security-related concerns relative to foreign investment. The U.N. concluded that certain types of economic activities and/or sectors are most likely to be subject to national security-related FDI limitations and/or review procedures. These activities include defense and security-related activities, investment in critical infrastructure, and foreign investments in strategic economic sectors. The broad concept of &quot;national security&quot; also translates into a variety of criteria that national authorities consider in their investment screening procedures.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn74" href="#fn74" title="Ibid., p. 94.">74</a></sup> These criteria have included the impact of a proposed transaction on: public safety, social order, plurality of the media, strategic national interests, foreign relations, disclosure of State secrets, territorial integrity, independence of the State, protection of rights and freedoms of citizens, continuity of public procurements, or terrorism related concerns.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn75" href="#fn75" title="Ibid., p. 95.">75</a></sup><sup> </sup></p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The U.N. analysis also indicated that countries have adopted different types of investment regulations to protect their foreign investment-related national security interests. These regulations include (1) prohibiting, fully or partially, foreign investment in certain sensitive sectors; (2) maintaining State monopolies in sensitive sectors; and (3) maintaining a foreign investment review mechanism for a list of predefined sectors or across the board. Some countries maintain two types of FDI review mechanisms, a sector-specific review procedure (e.g., in the defense industry) complemented by a separate cross-sectoral review mechanism for other foreign investments. In the latter case, countries may subject all FDI proposals to entry and establishment approval procedures or they may require approval only of FDI proposals that meet certain monetary thresholds. Some cross-sectoral review mechanisms do not require any prior notifications by investors and are instead initiated at the discretion of national authorities.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn76" href="#fn76" title="Ibid., p. 97.">76</a></sup><sup> </sup>Among the different changes adopted by various countries:</p><ul><li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples"><strong>Canada.</strong> In 2015, Canada amended its Investment Canada Regulations and the National Security Review of Investments Regulations to (1) require investors to provide more information and; (2) extended the length of certain time periods for the Government to carry out national security reviews.</li>

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The growing international presence and investment activity of firms that are owned by or controlled by foreign governments, sometimes referred to as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), are raising concerns over the economic and security implications of these firms. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) &quot;an estimated 22% of the world's largest 100 firms are now effectively under state control, the highest percentage in decades.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn79" href="#fn79" title="State-Owned Enterprises as Global Competitors: A Challenge or an Opportunity?, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2016, p. 13.">79</a></sup> This number has been enhanced by the growth of Chinese SOEs, as indicated in <strong>Figure 1</strong>. In particular, policymakers are concerned that some governments give preferential treatment to SOEs in ways that may convey a competitive edge in their overseas activities and may create anticompetitive effects in the global marketplace.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn80" href="#fn80" title="Ibid, p. 27.">80</a></sup> Such an association, for instance, may offer firms greater market protection at home from which they arguably can develop a strong competitive position, or offer access to below-market financing terms through other government-controlled entities, providing firms with a competitive advantage over firms that are subject to market conditions. Arguably, these types of close associations between firms and governments may blur the distinction between firms that engage in economic activities purely for commercial reasons and those that operate at the behest of a foreign government to achieve a public policy goal. As a result, some policymakers are concerned that SOEs may engage in foreign investment activities that could compromise national security objectives. OECD has found little evidence to date, however, that these potential advantages affect the international economic performance of SOEs. The OECD concluded that, &quot;Ownership is neither necessary for governments to influence an enterprises' operations, nor does it inevitably entail such influence.&quot;<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn81" href="#fn81" title="Ibid, p. 84.">81</a></sup></p>

For instance, corporate espionage is not an uncommon activity, but such activities by foreign firms that are owned or controlled by a foreign government often are viewed differently from such activities by firms that are engaging in corporate espionage for their own competitive interests. Corporate espionage by firms associated with a foreign government are viewed as not being motivated primarily for competitive commercial gains, but are directed primarily at achieving the national security interests of a foreign government.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn82" href="#fn82" title="Economic espionage for the benefit of a foreign government is treated differently in U.S. statutes from the theft of trade secrets for the benefit of an individual.

    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">On July 26, 2007, President Bush signed <a class="ExternalLink" href="http://www.congress.gov/cgi-lis/bdquery/R?d110:FLD002:@1(110+49)">P.L. 110-49</a>, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. The Treasury Department released its regulations implementing this law on November 21, 2008, as the global financial crisis was the focus of attention. In 2008, tight credit conditions associated with the global financial crisis and the slowdown in the rate of growth in the U.S. economy retarded merger and acquisition activities in the United States and abroad. In addition, the sub-prime mortgage crisis was just emerging and foreign investors had not yet taken substantial stakes in prominent U.S. financial firms. More recently, foreign investment activity has returned to a more normal level. In addition, the emergence of some developing economies, particularly China, and state-owned enterprises as active participants in the global foreign investment market are challenging some established notions of the role of foreign investment in the economy and the concept of what role economic issues should play within the rubric of national security.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">On June 20, 2011, the Obama Administration issued a formal statement on foreign investment declaring the countries' commitment to an open investment policy.<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn87" href="#fn87" title="Statement by the President on United States Commitment to Open Investment Policy, the White House, June 20, 2011.">87</a></sup> Some in Congress and elsewhere are dissatisfied, however, that the CFIUS statute in its present form does not address a broad range of issues concerning foreign investment. In part, this dissatisfaction stems from differing views of the role CFIUS should play and the concept of national security, particularly related to the concept of national economic security. For instance, some policymakers argue that CFIUS' mandate should be broadened to expressly consider the economic impact not only of individual foreign investment transactions, but the impact of such investments on industrial sectors as a whole and the role of state-owned enterprises as actors serving the policy interests of foreign governments. </p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">For some policymakers, an expanded CFIUS role may mean that CFIUS reviews would have a more robust economic component, possibly even to the extent of one that comprises an industrial policy-type approach and that uses the CFIUS national security review process as a means of protecting and promoting certain industrial sectors in the economy. Economists generally argue that such an approach puts the government in the position of choosing corporate and industry winners and losers and potentially jeopardizes efforts that have been made in the postwar period to promote internationally accepted norms that promote an open foreign investment climate. The proposed acquisition of P&amp;O by Dubai Ports World sparked a debate over such concerns and a wide-ranging discussion between Congress and the Bush Administration over a working set of parameters that establish a functional definition of the national economic security implications of foreign direct investment. The issue, however, exposed, but did not resoslve, differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the U.S. economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among Members and between Congress and the Administration.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The incident also focused attention on the informal process firms use to have their investment transactions reviewed by CFIUS prior to a formal review. According to anecdotal evidence, some firms apparently believe that the CFIUS process is not market neutral, but that it adds to market uncertainty that can negatively affect a firm's stock price and lead to economic behavior by some firms that is not optimal for the economy as a whole. Such behavior might involve firms expending a considerable amount of resources to avoid a CFIUS investigation, or deciding to terminate a transaction that would improve the optimal performance of the economy in order to avoid a CFIUS investigation. While such anecdotal evidence does not provide enough evidence to serve as the basis for developing public policy, it does raise a number of concerns about the possible impact that a CFIUS review may have on the market and the potential costs of redefining the concept of national security relative to foreign investment.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The focus by Congress on the Committee has also shown that the DP World transaction, in combination with other recent unpopular foreign investment transactions, exacerbated dissatisfaction among some Members of Congress over the operations of CFIUS. In particular, some Members were displeased with the discretionary authority the Committee has used to investigate certain foreign investment transactions. As a result, Congress strengthened its oversight by requiring more frequent contacts with CFIUS, which generally operates without much public or congressional attention.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The DP World transaction also revealed that the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks fundamentally altered the viewpoint of some Members of Congress regarding the role of foreign investment in the economy and over the impact of such investment on the national security framework. Some Members argued that this change in perspective required a reassessment of the role of foreign investment in the economy and of the implications of corporate ownership of activities that fall under the rubric of critical infrastructure. The emergence of state-owned enterprises as economic actors has raised additional concerns about whose interests and whose objectives such firms are pursuing in their foreign investment activities. As a result, Congress amended the CFIUS process to enhance Congress's oversight role while it reduced somewhat the discretion of CFIUS to review and investigate foreign investment transactions in order to have CFIUS investigate a larger number of foreign investment cases. In addition, the DP World transaction focused attention on long-unresolved issues concerning the role of foreign investment in the nation's overall security framework and the methods that are being used to assess the impact of foreign investment on the nation's defense industrial base, critical infrastructure, and homeland security.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The growing number of investments by Chinese firms continue to raise concerns by a number of groups over the economic and security impact of the investments, similar to concerns about Japanese investment in the United States in the 1980s. In particular, on October 8, 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence published a report<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn88" href="#fn88" title="Investigative Report on the U.S. National Security Issues Posed by Chinese Telecommunications Companies Huawei and ZTE: A Report by Chairman Mike Rogers and Ranking Member C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. House of Representatives, October 8, 2012.">88</a></sup> on the &quot;the counterintelligence and security threat posed by Chinese telecommunications companies doing business in the United States.&quot; The report offered a number of policy recommendations affecting CFIUS, including </p><ul><li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) must block acquisitions, takeovers, or mergers involving Huawei and ZTE given the threat to U.S. national security interests. Legislative proposals seeking to expand CFIUS to include purchasing agreements should receive thorough consideration by relevant congressional committees.</li>
    <li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Committees of jurisdiction in the U.S. Congress should consider potential legislation to better address the risk posed by telecommunications companies with nation-state ties or otherwise not clearly trusted to build critical infrastructure. Such legislation could include increasing information sharing among private sector entities, and an expanded role for the CFIUS process to include purchasing agreements.</li></ul><p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">In addition, in November 2012, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission<sup><a class="FootnoteLink" name="ifn89" href="#fn89" title="2012 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, November 2012.">89</a></sup> issued a report that detailed concerns over Chinese investments by U.S. industries, lawmakers, and government officials about the ''potential economic distortions and national security concerns arising from China's system of state-supported and state-led economic growth.&quot; In particular, some observers argued that economic concerns focused on the possibility that state-backed Chinese companies choose to invest ''based on strategic rather than market-based considerations,'' and are free from the constraints of market forces because of generous state subsidies. The report proffered a number of recommendations for amending the CFIUS statute:</p><ul><li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Congress examine foreign direct investment from China to the United States and assess whether there is a need to amend the underlying statute (50 U.S.C. app 2170) for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to (1) require a mandatory review of all controlling transactions by Chinese state-owned and state-controlled companies investing in the United States; (2) add a net economic benefit test to the existing national security test that CFIUS administers; and (3) prohibit investment in a U.S. industry by a foreign company whose government prohibits foreign investment in that same industry. </li>
    <li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Legislation creating the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) could be amended to add a test of ''economic benefit'' of a Chinese investment in the United States.</li>
    <li class="ListBullet" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">CFIUS's jurisdiction be extended to include ''greenfield'' investments, or investments in new industrial plants and facilities.</li></ul><p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">Economists generally agree that there is little economic evidence to date to conclude that the nationality of a foreign investor or whether the foreign investor is a private entity or an entity that is owned or controlled by a foreign government has a measurable impact on the market performance of the firm or on the U.S. economy. This conclusion does not attempt to assess the differences in economic performance or national security concerns that potentially may arise between privately owned foreign firms and those that are owned or controlled by a foreign government that engage in such illegal activities as corporate espionage. Others may argue that firms that are owned or controlled by a foreign government pose a risk to national security or to homeland security, but such concerns are not within the purview of this report. Similar issues concerning corporate ownership were raised during the late 1980s and early 1990s when foreign investment in the U.S. economy increased rapidly. There are little new data, however, to alter the conclusion reached at that time that there is no definitive way to assess the economic impact of foreign ownership or of foreign investment on the economy. Although some observers have expressed concerns about foreign investors who are owned or controlled by foreign governments acquiring U.S. firms, there is little confirmed evidence that such a distinction in corporate ownership has any effect on the economy as whole.</p>
    <p class="BodyText" style="" xmlns:ns2="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vsto/samples">For most economists, the distinction between domestic- and foreign-owned firms, whether the foreign firms are privately owned or controlled by a foreign government, is sufficiently small that they would argue that it does not warrant placing restrictions on the inflow of foreign investment. Nevertheless, foreign direct investment does entail various economic costs and benefits. On the benefit side, such investments bring added capital into the economy and potentially could add to productivity growth and innovation. Such investment also represents one repercussion of the U.S. trade deficit. The deficit transfers dollar-denominated assets to foreign investors, who then decide how to hold those assets by choosing among various investment vehicles, including direct investment. Foreign investment also removes a stream of monetary benefits from the economy in the form of repatriated capital and profits that reduces the total amount of capital in the economy. Such costs and benefits likely occur whether the foreign owner is a private entity or a foreign government.</p>

          <p class="FootnoteText" style=""> Economic espionage for the benefit of a foreign government is treated differently in U.S. statutes from the theft of trade secrets for the benefit of an individual. U.S. Code title 18, section 1831 provides for a fine of not more than $5 million or a prison term of no more than 15 years, or both for economic espionage for the benefit of a foreign government, while U.S. Code title 18, section 1832 on the theft of trade secrets for the benefit of an individual provides for a penalty of no more than $5 million or a prison term of no more than 10 years, or both.
